Welcome to the Data Structures & Algorithms Lab @ sbohfm! 🔎

### Status: [ Not started yet ]

This is my personal space to save and also showcase my learning feats to whoever might be interested.

Data Structures and Algorithms are one of the fundamental parts of the computer science field and the mastering of some of these concepts will give valuable resources, insights and advantages not only for job hunting but also in the daily working life as a developer/programmer.

This field of CS is, in a basic form, the internalization and sharpening of the concepts and techniques regarding how to use storage space and processing power effectively to solve data-related challenges.

Feel free to explore, but keep in mind that this is the most \*a work in progress\* you've ever seen.


### How things works in this repl?

Since someone else that is not me (you) can explore this repl, it should also be a good idea to record useful notes that someone could take advantage of. That's why **this is not just a collection of handy algorithms** but also a *documented* one. Every folder will be guided in a way it doesn't get too technical or clumsy (without prior warning), and as such, will try to maintaing this simple pattern:

```
root-folder
  └ /readme.md         <-- intro + explanation and concepts
  └ /file.c            <-- same intro + insights + comments
  └ /other-folders
    └ /readme.md
    └ /other-files.c
    └ ...
```

### Talking about folders...

... these are the main branches we'll find here ⬇️

- 📁 **All-paths graph traversal**: Algorithms that tackle path finding problems, such as the *Shortest Path Problem* and also flow feasiblity challenges, such as the *Maximum Flow Problem*.
---
- 📁 **Array manipulation**: Well-known low-level manipulation of arrays, such as reversing, finding min-max-median value, etc.
---
- 📁 **Enumeration problems**: 
---
- 📁 **File manipulation**: 
---
- 📁 **Linked list traversal**: 
---
- 📁 **Reverse engineering**: 
---
- 📁 **Searching**: 
---
- 📁 **Sorting**:
